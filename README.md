# blackjackpy
Simple implementation of blackjack in python, currently missing a few things. Will be commented more soon.

Planned features: End the player's turn if they have 21, Chips + Saving & Loading, Split, Double-Down, Notifying the player when a hand is soft instead of leaving them to figure it out themselves.
